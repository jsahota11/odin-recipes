    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe came from my grandmother. It holds lots importance to me and my family. After the vietnam war, my grandfather returned home and did not ask for anything other than this burger. Understandably, my grandmother was happy since she understood how important this burger was to everyone in our bloodline. Ever since the creation of cows, this burger had been refined through generations into what it is today.

        Indeed, this recipe will only sharpen and become even more incredible throughout the future, and only those that understand the importance of food will truly feel their tastebuds ascend. This recipe is both the gateway and key to friendship, future relations, and opportunity. In a true world, there is a single constant which is shared with that world and our own. That constant is none other than this burger. I hope you taste the burger and understand the magnitude of the actions that have just taken place by your hand. I hope you understand the levity of what you have done here.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe came from my grandmother. It holds lots importance to me and my family. After the vietnam war, my grandfather returned home and did not ask for anything other than this burger. Understandably, my grandmother was happy since she understood how important this burger was to everyone in our bloodline. Ever since the creation of cows, this burger had been refined through generations into what it is today.

    <p>
        Indeed, this recipe will only sharpen and become even more incredible throughout the future, and only those that understand the importance of food will truly feel their tastebuds ascend. This recipe is both the gateway and key to friendship, future relations, and opportunity. In a true world, there is a single constant which is shared with that world and our own. That constant is none other than this burger. I hope you taste the burger and understand the magnitude of the actions that have just taken place by your hand. I hope you understand the levity of what you have done here.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 burger buns</li>
        <li>10 oz beef</li>
        <li>1 slice of American cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Pickle</li>
        <li>Mayo</li>
        <li>My sauce which you cannot have</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Understand that you will never be able to make this burger due to the sauce you cannot have.</li>
        <li>Understand that even with this sauce, you will never be able to make it as brilliantly as my family had for generations.</li>
        <li>Understand that even if you could have made this burger as perfectly as I and my family have for centuries, your tastebuds could not possibly comprehend the ecstasy this fair dish provides the person.</li>
        <li>Make a burger patty from the beef and begin cooking it.</li>
        <li>While it is cooking, you may chop and carmalise the onions.</li>
        <li>While it is cooking, chop the tomato to form two neat slices.</li>
        <li>Your burger should almost be done, but still cooking. If not, you messed up somewhere. Restart the recipe. </li>
        <li>While the burger is finishing up cooking, put the cheese on it.</li>
        <li>Take the burger off and put the buns in the greese of the burger to toast them and add some flavour.</li>
        <li>Take the buns out and lather the insides with mayo, and begin chopping the pickle.</li>
        <li>Place the ingredients as shown in the picture above, except for my sauce. That is not possible.</li>
        <li>Plate the burger with some sort of side to compensate for the lack of radiance given the missing sauce. </li>
        <li>Eat the burger and regret your decisions.</li>
        
    </ol>

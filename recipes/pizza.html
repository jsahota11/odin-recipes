    <h1 class="heading" id="title">King of Pizza from New York Known Worldwide as King-of-Pizza Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../img/pizza.jpg" alt = "delicious-looking pizza.">


    <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
    <p>This is what the king of pizza looks like. It may not look like much, but that is due to the fact that kingdoms bring conquest. Having a king displayed as a king is a prime target for attackers, and so this king of pizzas must not look the part, else it runs the risk of being conquered by some other sort of pizza. This is the cost of war, but it is a neccesary sacrifice. For the people, and for freedom.</p>
    <p>The pizza itself tastes like pizza straight from a mom-and-pop shop in the heart of Queens, Flushing, Harlem, or any other place in New York. In modern slang, this pizza is the definition of a "sleeper pizza." It may not look spontaneous, but judging this book by its cover is a terrible idea.</p>

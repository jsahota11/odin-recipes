    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Have you ever wanted to ascend beyond your human body? Perhaps you wish to become one with the machine, or ascend beyond the mortal plane into the afterlife. While this poutine cannot merge you with a computer, it can certainly ascend you to heaven or the like! This poutine is rooted in Canadian ancestry and origins, and the technique and craftsmanship had been revisited and revitalized time and time again to create the most breathtaking poutine you will ever witness.</p>
    <p>The origins of such a recipe date back around 4.6 billion years ago with the rise of the bipedal Homo Erectus. Members of the genus at some point inscribed the recipe into a stone and left it deep in a cave in Africa. This is monumental, as symbolic language had not yet been dated and documented, and was dated an earliest of 800 000 years ago. Long later, neanderthals around 400 000 years ago found the recipe and applied it, creating the most heavenly flavours possible at the time. It was so moving, that they had used cave art to convey the recipe, which anthropologists have rediscovered around 200 years ago in a cave underwater and underneath the center of the Bering Strait, which was not accessible at the time due to unmoving glaciars. As you can see, this recipe itself had surpassed beyond mortal capabilities and transcended time to appear before us today. Throughout all this time, the recipe had been refined as well. You will be tasting over 4 billion years worth of blood, sweat, and tears in this dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fries or potato, but you will have to chop the potato to make fries.</li>
        <li>Gravy from the store, please do not use your own. If you have your own gravy on hand, please throw it away. That is disguisting.</li>
        <li>Cheese curds from the store. If you have access to a cow, go nuts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin cooking the fries with oil to doubly fry them.</li>
        <li>While they cook, heat up the gravy until its steaming hot.</li>
        <li>While both the fries and gravy come to an end, begin defrosting the cheese curds to get them to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Once the cooking and gravy is complete, plate the fries and generously apply the cheese curds on top.</li>
        <li>Pour the gravy overtop the craft to melt the cheese curds as well.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

# odin-recipes

This repo is for a website made for an assignment within the The Odin Project curriculum. 
The goal is to demonstrate skills in HTML by creating a small collection of recipes in HTML.
The homepage links to those recipes, which display headers of different sizes, images, lists and paragraphs.
Lastly, we publish the site for others to view.

This project was fun. I got carried away with the descriptions.
I think the tags are annoying but once I get used to them I will be fine. Or maybe there are shortcuts I am unaware of.
I did not really struggle with this.
Next time, I will take advantage of copy-paste.
I am happy with my commits and pushes and I think I did a good job keeping Git updated.
Overall, I am happy with the outcome.
Next time, I will try to incorporate bold text and italicized text more.
